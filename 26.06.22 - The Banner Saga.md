# The Banner Saga
- **Artistic clarity**
	- When an enemy is in a simple attack range from active hero, the game puts a red token on this enemy. The range is calculated from current hero's position or from one of the new possible positions, which player may consider before committing their move action. A number inside the token indicates a strength damage the hero will cause by their simple attack to this enemy.
- **Design clarity**
	- In the beginning of a player's turn the game automatically puts the player in a movement stage, suggesting them to start their turn with movement.  If the player has made a move action, *the action wheel* pops up immediately near an active hero, and the player sees the rest of available actions.
	  This design decision is good for 2 reasons:
	  1. *It introduces a new players to the battle system's core loop*: choose position => make an action => repeat 
	  2. *It breaks player's decision process in a smaller pieces*, which prevents the player from analysis paralysis 
- **Technical clarity**
	- An outcome of battle mechanics is unambiguous. All combatants are basically chess pieces with defined movement patterns and there is almost no chance involved in damage calculation. My guess is that such predictability allows to build a more controlled AI behaviour
