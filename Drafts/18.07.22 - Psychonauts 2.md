# Psychonauts 2
- **Artistic clarity**
	- Censor red stamp attacks and stunned animation
- **Design clarity** 
	- New skills are introduced through the story challenges
	- Mother lobe is a playground to explore and progress
- **Technical clarity**
	- Levels are repayable and it allows to design levels for future skills 
	-  Skills wheel 

### One the Most Clear Thing
- It's a platformed game. The main character is small, but all the objects around him are big. You mast jump and climb and find detours to progress through levels

### Possible Improvements
- The fire in game looks dangerous but it doesn't deal damage to Riz. It feels weird. Maybe redraw fire animation with more friendly colors(?)  

## Motivation

### Reward VS Experience
- **Reward focused design**
	- Explore levels to find upgrades and money stashes 
- **Experience focused design**
	- Fun interaction with NPC in dialogues and cavolerience
	- Deep exploration and gamified of NPC stories 

### Chris VS Ralph
- **Patient collectors reward for the risk**
	-  
- **How do games make it more difficult for reckless rushers?**
	- Big censors will most probably hurt Riz if confronted while they not stunned. Safer and smarter tactic is to stun them

### Awareness and Relevancy
