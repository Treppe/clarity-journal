# Attack animation analysis
**Questions to ask:**
- What kind of attack animations are appropriate for this game?
- How long should they be?
- Why did they pick this length?
- What would happen if you doubled the animation length?
- Halved it?

## Psychonauts 2
### Example 1 - Raz's melee attack

- **How long this animation is?**
	- About 0.5 seconds for one hit 
- **Why did they pick this length?**
	- It creates focused battle dynamic with a flexibility to escape. It's long enough to make a player fixated on one enemy at a time. And it's short enough to quickly change your strategy from attacking to dodging, by sending dodge command to animation queue.
