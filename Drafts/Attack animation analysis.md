# Attack animation analysis
**Questions to ask:**
- What kind of attack animations are appropriate for this game?
- How long should they be?
- Why did they pick this length?
- What would happen if you doubled the animation length?
- Halved it?

## Psychonauts 2 - Raz's melee attack

- **How long this animation is?**
	- About 0.5 seconds for one hit 
- **Why did they pick this length?**
	- It creates focused battle dynamic with a flexibility to escape
	- It's long enough to make a player fixated on one enemy at a time
	- It's short enough to quickly change your strategy from attacking to dodging, by sending dodge command to animation queue
- **What would happen if you doubled the animation length?**
	- It would lead to more punishing combat gameplay. Longer attack animations = longer periods without an ability to dodge, jump away
	- Raz himself would feel heavier. It would feel like he is wielding a small hammer instead of  raining a series of psychic slaps
- **Halved it?**
	- It would weaker a tension of "lose mobility to fight"
	- Fighting an enemy would feel less like "fighting with it", and more like "manipulating over it"

## Divinity: Original Sin 2 - Spellcasting

- **How long this animation is?**
	- Anticipation: little less then 1 second
	- Attack + follow through:  about 2 seconds
	- Recovery: almost immediate 
- **Why did they pick this length?**
	- Visible anticipation time to sell the charging feel of upcoming attack, ask a player where to channel this charge
	- Long attack presentation to reward the player and clearly show an outcomes
	- Immediate recovery to suggest and shift players attentions to the battle decision
- **What would happen if you doubled the animation length?**
	- It would be unnecessary long and "dancy". Each time player would cast a spell it would see a long character's choreography. It would break the game's tempo and undermine most possibly not so powerful spell effect 
- **Halved it?**
	- Characters would feel less physique and alive. They would feel less like characters and more like mechanical strategy units. 

## Civilization VI - Melee units attack

- **How long this animation is?**
	- Anticipation: almost immediate
	- Attack + follow through:  about 3 seconds
	- Recovery: about 2 seconds
- **Why did they pick this length?**
	- There is no need in long anticipation because an attack is proactive choice in the game. Even before animation starts the game already told the player through UI, that they are about to attack
	- An attack and recovery of attack are emphasized with long times frames. The length is used to clearly show the difference (or a lack of it) of armies power level
- **What would happen if you doubled the animation length?**
	- Battles would feel more epic than they need to be. It would be cool for historic game to show 2 armies are crushing into each other and having a 6 seconds of very detailed fight, but it also would get annoying pretty fast. 
- **Halved it?**
	- The game would not be able to clearly communicate to a player a power difference between armies.
	- It worth to mention, that there is an option to turn off a battle animation in the game entirely, which is often used by more experienced players. Once the player learns when and why their units might be weaker than proponent's units, there is no reason to be reminded about it (except appreciation of feel the animation create)


## Overwatch - Default attacks

- **How long this animation is?**
	- All heroes attack almost immediately with a twitch animation
	- The longest it can take is about half a second for heavy heroes (e.g. Reinhardt , Roadhog) attacks
- **Why did they pick this length?**
	- It leads to more dynamic gameplay, which maximizes player's decision per time metric
	- It sells the high-tech aesthetic of the Overwatch world
- **What would happen if you doubled the animation length?**
	- It would lead to more sneaky and strategic gameplay, instead of upfront confrontation, that Overwatch now have  
- **Halved it?**
	- It would be hard to process what's going on, when playing the first time
	- It would make heroes with already fast animations feel static. Their attacks would feel unresponsive
