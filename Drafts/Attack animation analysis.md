# Attack animation analysis
**Questions to ask:**
- What kind of attack animations are appropriate for this game?
- How long should they be?
- Why did they pick this length?
- What would happen if you doubled the animation length?
- Halved it?

## Psychonauts 2 - Raz's melee attack

- **How long this animation is?**
	- About 0.5 seconds for one hit 
- **Why did they pick this length?**
	- It creates focused battle dynamic with a flexibility to escape
	- It's long enough to make a player fixated on one enemy at a time
	- It's short enough to quickly change your strategy from attacking to dodging, by sending dodge command to animation queue
- **What would happen if you doubled the animation length?**
	- It would lead to more punishing combat gameplay. Longer attack animations = longer periods without an ability to dodge, jump away
	- Raz himself would feel heavier. It would feel like he is wielding a small hammer instead of  raining a series of psychic slaps
- **Halved it?**
	- It would weaker a tension of "lose mobility to fight"
	- Fighting an enemy would feel less like "fighting with it", and more like "manipulating over it"

## Divinity: Original Sin 2 - Spellcasting

- **How long this animation is?**
	- Anticipation: little less then 1 second
	- Attack + follow through:  about 2 seconds
	- Recovery: almost immediate 
- **Why did they pick this length?**
	- Visible anticipation time to sell the charging feel of upcoming attack, ask a player where to channel this charge
	- Long attack presentation to reward the player and clearly show an outcomes
	- Immediate recovery to suggest and shift players attentions to the battle decision
- **What would happen if you doubled the animation length?**
	- It would be unnecessary long and "dancy". Each time player would cast a spell it would see a long character's choreography. It would break the game's tempo and undermine most possibly not so powerful spell effect 
- **Halved it?**
	- Characters would feel less physique and alive. They would feel less like characters and more like mechanical strategy units.
