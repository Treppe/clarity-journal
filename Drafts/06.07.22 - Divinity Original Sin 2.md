### Chris VS Ralph
- **Patient collectors reward for future risk**
	- The court over sorcerer in Joy Island. It's a risky area with difficult enemies, and there is no story reason for player to be there. But if player arrives there, they see a dramatic execution scene and may get access for powerful items.  
- **How do games make it more difficult for reckless rushers?**
	- Good pre-battle positioning matters
	- Forces player to strategize around magic/physical armour
	- Lots of powerful guards in Fort Joy make it difficult for a player to escape it on early levels  
	- Once you battled a member of the fraction you become an enemy of the whole fraction (?)

### Awareness and Relevancy
