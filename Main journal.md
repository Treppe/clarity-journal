# Hearthstone Battlegrounds 
## Clarity
- **Artistic clarity**
	- Intense artistic emphasis on finding a triple communicates its gameplay importance. The specific instances of this emphasis are:
		- An up-arrow overlapping a creature in Bob's tavern, which indicates an available triple. An arrow is big and moving in its own rhythm, which makes it stand out even during fast paced series of tavern refreshes
		- The Bob saying "Looks like you can get a triple"
		- A visually striking animation of creatures merging in a triple
- **Design clarity** 
	- A unique special abilities of each hero are taking advantage of existing battlegrounds mechanics, and by doing so the game prompts to a player an idea of their possible winning strategies.
- **Technical clarity**
	- The modular gameplay, provided by a game phases, facilitates an implementation of a new depth-adding game features. Designers can take an already existing game's mechanics and put them in uncustomary game phases, thereby possibly adding a new dynamics in a game. One of the examples of the feature made in a such way is a *Start of combat* keyword.

## One the Most Clear Thing
- All actions available to the player are clear from the first glance, thanks for
	- big action buttons with descriptive icons and short follow-up texts emphasising only what is important
	-  green and blue glowing edges of elements giving a clue on what else player could do 

## Possible Improvements 
- The heroes like Cariel, Kurtus, Azshara, Ragnaros has a progression of ability mechanic. But it's not clear from ability descriptions of these heroes how exactly ability progresses.
-  The order of triggering a deathrattle, start of combat and other special abilities is unclear
- Gold pieces animations are buggy in almost every patch

# The Banner Saga
- **Artistic clarity**
	- When an enemy is in a simple attack range from active hero, the game puts a red token on this enemy. The range is calculated from current hero's position or from one of the new possible positions, which player may consider before committing their move action. A number inside the token indicates a strength damage the hero will cause by their simple attack to this enemy.
	  This feature provides a player with a clarity on their current and possible status, and empowers a strategic dynamic of the game.
- **Design clarity**
	- In the beginning of a player's turn the game automatically puts the player in a movement stage, suggesting them to start their turn with movement.  If the player has made a move action, *the action wheel* pops up immediately near an active hero, and the player sees the rest of available actions.
	  This design decision is good for 2 reasons:
	  1. *It introduces a new players to the battle system's core loop*: choose position => make an action => repeat 
	  2. *It breaks player's decision process in a smaller pieces*, which prevents the player from analysis paralysis 
- **Technical clarity**
	- An outcomes of battle mechanics are unambiguous. All combatants are basically chess pieces with defined movement patterns and there is almost no chance involved in a damage calculation. My guess is that such predictability allows to build a more controlled AI behaviour, and it was easier for designers to orchestrate dramatic moments of player's tension and relaxation in an intended way.

# Catherine
* ***Artistic clarity**
	* "*EDGE!*". The game provides the most intense feedback on the most important game mechanic - edge connection. Each time edges are connected the player sees an exploding blue edge glow and the female narrators voice saying "Edge!". 
	  A clarity in this aspect is one of the main reasons why this time restricted, puzzle solving game feels so smooth and addictive, despite its frustrating difficulty.
* ***Design clarity**
	*  The ladder-like level structure clearly communicates the level's goal: *reach the top of the ladder*; and states a short term goal: *find a way to  climb the next step*. 
	* The game is not shy to communicate the player's goals status and threats through a text, because the text in a game is delivered to a player in an engaging ways:
		* narrated tutorial pieces
		* narrated UI interactions
		* voiced cut-scene dialogues 
		* interactive text messages on a phone  
- **Technical clarity**
	- The ladder puzzle game idea is so elegant, that, despite being implemented as a real-time action game, it could be easily described in discrete terms of turn based game. Such atomicity has a huge value when it comes to prototyping and system formalization of the game.
