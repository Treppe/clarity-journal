* ***Artistic clarity**
	* The Narrator's voice follows each action in main menu and introduces you to new game mechanics
	* Bright glowing VFX  when blocks are stacked
* ***Design clarity**
	* The ladder-like level structure clearly communicates the goal
	* The last (the hardest) puzzle on the first level makes sure that a player will learn one of the most important game strategies: building ladders with blocks stuck mid air
- **Technical clarity**
	- The main character's phone as a quest log, dialog window and hall of fame at the same time
