## What did games do that made me really care?
- **Built worlds of fantasy where I can make meaningful choices and express myself**
	- Pillars of Eternity I-II
	- Divinity: Original Sin II
	- Tyranny
	- Civilisation  V-VI
	- D&D
	- Disco Elysium 
- **Created a common experience with other people**
	- D&D
	- Minecraft
	- It Takes Two
	- Dota 2
	- Injustice: Gods Among Us
	- Tabletop and party games
- **Stress relief**
	- Hearthstone
	- Civilisation V-VI
	- Pok√©mon games

## What are three examples of games that made you not care?
- **Black Book**
	- The game's card based battle system felt artificial and broke narrative immersion
- **Dragon Age: Inquisition**
	- FedEx quests completion and grinding points of influence is necessary to progress the main story. Such activities were boring and felt like unnecessary obstacles  
	- Game has a big open-world locations, but with low density of events in them
	- The main story is complete only with additions from DLC 
- **Later Alligator**
	- Similarly to Black Book, the story and atmosphere immersion was broken for me every time I had to solve a new puzzle / win new mini-game
