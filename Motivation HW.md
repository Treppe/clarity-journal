# Motivation HW
## What did games do that made me really care?
- **Built worlds of fantasy where I can make meaningful choices and express myself**
	- Pillars of Eternity I-II
	- Divinity: Original Sin II
	- Tyranny
	- Civilisation  V-VI
	- D&D
	- Disco Elysium 
- **Created a common experience with other people**
	- D&D
	- Minecraft
	- It Takes Two
	- Dota 2
	- Injustice: Gods Among Us
	- Tabletop and party games
- **Stress relief**
	- Hearthstone
	- Civilisation V-VI
	- Pok√©mon games

## What are three examples of games that made you not care?
- **Black Book**
	- The game's card based battle system felt artificial and broke narrative immersion
- **Dragon Age: Inquisition**
	- FedEx quests completion and grinding points of influence is necessary to progress the main story. Such activities were boring and felt like unnecessary obstacles  
	- Game has a big open-world locations, but with low density of events in them
	- The main story is complete only with additions from DLC 
- **Later Alligator**
	- Similarly to Black Book, the story and atmosphere immersion was broken for me every time I had to solve a new puzzle / win new mini-game

## Rewarding Different Players
Game | Patient collectors reward for the risk | How do games make it more difficult for reckless rushers?
---|---|---
Divinity: Original Sin 2 | The court over sorcerer in Joy Island. It's a risky area with difficult enemies, and there is no story reason for player to be there. But if player arrives there, they see a dramatic execution scene and may get access for powerful items. |  Good pre-battle positioning matters; Forces player to strategize around magic/physical armour; Lots of powerful guards in Fort Joy make it difficult for a player to escape it on early levels
Disco Elysium | By tapping more radically in communism/capitalism ideology you get access to more quests then by standing in the middle | The main quest completion pace is limited by days counter. And there is an exploration and puzzle solving process involved in finding and utilising a tools for day time skips
Darkest Dungeon |  There is a chance of becoming virtuous when hero hits stress 100 | Heroes are dying and loosing their progress permanently; Heroes need to relieve their stress to not die 
The Witness | There are no tips for some puzzles. The only way to learn them is by trial and error | You must succeed on previous puzzles and make sure that you learned their rule before progressing further 
Elden Ring | The only way to develop a tactic against bosses is by fighting them and dying. Player must accept the risk to complete the game |  Player looses their runes when they die; Health restoration is limited; All enemies are respawned after rest; New enemies have new moveset and require developing new tactics
Dorfromantic | *not found* | The limited amount of tiles in main game mode 
HS Battlegrounds | Faster tavern upgrades may give you early access to powerful and limited high tier creatures | You want a variety of creatures in your warband and synergies, and you also want to collect triples. And the board space is limited.
The Banner Saga | War options lets you to manage your caravan casualties by accepting or denying the battle. The harder challenge you accept the lower casualties you will have; The second phase of the war. The "greedy" option allowing you to take unnecessary risk for more renown  | Player must choose dialogue options and choose their battles wisely if they don't want to lose their heroes
Pillars of Eternity II |  Subclasses penalty. More risk grants more power | Fighting a member of fraction makes you an enemy for all members of this fraction; Enemies and quests of higher level are marked as *hard*
Catherine |  If you spent time on coins collection during Nightmare, you can buy special items; The harder your game mode the more score you gain | By moving the wrong blocks you can make the whole level unsolvable
